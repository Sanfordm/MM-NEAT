# ZELDA DUNGEON AI FINAL PROJECT
This project implements dungeon making to the Zelda GAN. There is an added button in the main screen, allowing the user to evolve rooms for the dungeon. After selecting the rooms, clicking the "Dungeonize" button will bring up a playable version of the random dungeon created from the user selected rooms.

##Getting Started
Use the instructions provided in the MM-NEAT repository.

##Current Issues
* Unable to connect rooms and ensure dungeon full playability.
* Room rotation to mirror original zelda game unavailable.

##Contribution
Professor Jacob Schrum for providing MM-NEAT repository and technical help for understanding the code
